### Deprecation Notice

The Spring Security OAuth project is deprecated. The latest OAuth 2.0 support is provided by Spring Security. See the [OAuth 2.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Migration-Guide) for further details.

# Developers Guide

## Preparation

You're going to want to be quite familiar with
[OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2) (and/or
[OAuth](https://oauth.net) ) and
[Spring Security](https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/),
to maximize the effectiveness of this developers guide. OAuth for
Spring Security is tightly tied to both technologies, so the more
familiar you are with them, the more likely you'll be to recognize the
terminology and patterns that are used.

## Options

Your first decision is whether you need to leverage support for OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, or both.

So pick your poison:

* [OAuth 1.0](oauth1.html)
* [OAuth 2](oauth2.html)
